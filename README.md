# NFL Hall of Fame Webscraper and Analysis

## Overview
First created a webscraper using the BeautifulSoup library from Python to scrape the a website that contained stats of every player in the NFL Hall of Fame. Afterwards, I cleaned the data and then used the os library to create a csv file. From here, I then analyzed the data by creating bar graphs and finding averages to see what qualifies someone to enter the Hall of Fame based on their stats and position. 

## Tools / Languages Used:
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python
  *Libraries: BeautifulSoup, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, os, urlopen
  
# Files Included (In Order):
